I see you've found your way into this folder. Ideal.
Back here is where the magic happens.

In "Code & Assets" you'll find the HTML, CSS and JavaScript documents that are needed for the game to work plus
all the .png images and .wav audio files that are in the game.

In "Web gamebook design" you'll find images and documentation that will help guide you through this game and its
interface.

Enjoy :)
